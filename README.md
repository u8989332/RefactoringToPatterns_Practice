# Refactoring To Patterns
My practices of the book Refactoring To Patterns.

Joshua Kerievsky's book [Refactoring to Patterns](https://amzn.to/3FNMrhJ).

# Let's Get Started

## Language && IDE Concerns
All code samples are written in C# with the following environment

* [Visual Studio 2022 (on Windows)](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/older-downloads/)
* [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

## Project Structure

My practices include chapter 6 Creation to chapter 11 Utilities. Each sub chapter of these main chapters has implements the "Before" and "After" code sample.

### Before folder
This folder has the code with some code smells.
But chapter 6's "Encapsulate Composite with Builder" has no this folder.

### After folder
I use the refactoring skill introduced by the sub chapter of the book and refactor the "Before" code sample. The refactored code is placed in "After" folder.

### Unit Testing
Except chapter 7's "Move Embellishment to Decorator", I have created unit testing projects corresponding to the refactored code sample projects.

## Conclusion

I have read Martin Fowler's [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://amzn.to/3LUmBwI) before I read this [Refactoring to Patterns](https://amzn.to/3FNMrhJ). Most concrete refactoring skills has built in my brain but I have no more obvious refactoring patterns in my mind. Thank to this book, I have learned more about "Code readability", "Reusability", "Maintainability", "Scalability", "Consistency" and "Collaboration".
Let's make software greater!
